## Description üéÑ

This is my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions year by year. I write my solutions in Python and try to only use built-in modules and methods. I borrowed the Python script template from [a *Real Python* article](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/#the-structure-of-a-solution) where each day's script will have three main functions `parse()`, `solve_part1()`, and `solve_part2()` that are used in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block. Each day comes with two .txt files that contain puzzle inputs: 'day##_text.txt' containing the example puzzle input and 'day##_input.txt' containing my actual puzzle input. 

## Year 2022 üéÑ

This is my first year doing AoC. I got through the first ten days without much sweat, and I'm glad that I had some familiarity with `itertools` and `collections` methods from doing Python Morsels exercises over the years. I found that solving problems without importing PyPI modules led to more elegant and faster solutions that became necessary for solving part 2's. 

Starting around day 16, to my frustration, I had to peek at other Python solutions posted on Reddit. From day 20 onward, I really wanted to be done (January was almost over), so I would go straight to Reddit and read as many solutions as I can first before solving. This turned out to be a good use of my time because rarely did one single solution strike me as ideal either from the perspective of readability or solution design consistency. My own scripts ended up taking bits and pieces from various sources, with more annotation and tests. Finally, while cleaning up and organizing all the scripts, I looked at [Peter Norvig's solution](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), adopting many of [his utility data structures and functions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/AdventUtils.ipynb). 

My first year of Advent of Code has been a dense learning experience. Since I don't have a computer science background, I learned how to write path-finding algorithms from solving the many path-search problems (days [12](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/1386eac2219ace58f82ba13bb7199d6a72ed0db9/year2022/day12_hill_climbing_algorithm.py), [13](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/bbe95de0983d5c93506494581cafc482190cf01d/year2022/day13_distress_signal.py), [16](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day16_proboscidea_volcanium.py), [18](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/1710c6b423aab554e832e2c30b737a290420c58c/year2022/day18_boiling_boulders.py), and [24](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day24_blizzard_basin.py)). I got to practice on writing recursive functions (days [21](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day21_moneky_math.py) and [25](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day25_full_of_hot_air.py)). And though I didn't adopt them in my final scripts, I saw some creative solutions that navigated grids with [bitwise operators](https://github.com/juanplopes/advent-of-code-2022/blob/6794122df32a857827e0c49871e848afe62cff18/day16.py) and complex numbers to represent up-down-left-right directions. I want to keep doing Advent of Code as a holiday tradition. My thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) for writing these whimsical puzzles, and hat tip to [Michael Driscoll](https://twitter.com/driscollis?s=20) from whose tweet I learned the existence of Advent of Code.
