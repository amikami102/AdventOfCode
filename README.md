## Description

This is my repository for [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions year by year. I write my solutions in Python and try to only use built-in modules and methods. I borrowed the Python script template from [a *Real Python* article](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/#the-structure-of-a-solution). Each day has 'day##_text.txt' that contains the example puzzle input copied from the problem statement and 'day##_input.txt', which contains my actual puzzle input. 

## Year 2022

This is my first year doing Advent of Code. I got through the first ten days without much sweat, and I'm glad that I had some familiarity with `itertools` and `collections` methods from doing Python Morsels exercises over the years. I found that solving problems without importing PyPI modules led to more elegant and faster solutions that became necessary for solving part 2's. 

Starting around day 16, to my frustration, I had to peak at other Python solutions posted on Reddit. From day 20 onward, I really wanted to be done (January was almost over), so I would go straight to Reddit and read as many solutions as I can first before solving. This turned out to be a good use of my time because rarely did one single solution strike me as ideal. My own scripts ended up taking bits and pieces from various sources, with more annotation and tests. 

My first year of Advent of Code has been a dense learning experience. Since I don't have a computer science background, I learned how to write path-finding algorithms from solving the many path-search problems (days [12](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/1386eac2219ace58f82ba13bb7199d6a72ed0db9/year2022/day12_hill_climbing_algorithm.py), [16](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day16_proboscidea_volcanium.py), and [24](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day24_blizzard_basin.py)). I got to write more recursion functions (days [21](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day21_moneky_math.py) and [25](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode/blob/54bdad0e0f1b672e53f3b69b3efd9ab8cf8fc041/year2022/day25_full_of_hot_air.py)). And though I didn't adopt them in my final scripts, I saw some creative solutions that navigated grids with bitwise operators and complex numbers to represent up-down-left-right directions. I want to keep doing Advent of Code as a holiday tradition. My thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) for writing these puzzles and [Paul Driscoll](https://twitter.com/driscollis?s=20) from whose tweet I learned the existence of Advent of Code.
